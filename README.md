Searching for the lightweight coin binary vs trinary

Details:

You are give X coins. And You know all the coins weigh the same except one. One coin is lighter
than all the rest. All you have is the coins and an old balance scale that tells if you either 
one side is heavier or they weights are equal.  How do you find the light coin?

Binary search is fast right?  You would think so.  Either my code is bad or Trinary is the
way to go here.


Run it like so:

ruby coin_finder.rb
